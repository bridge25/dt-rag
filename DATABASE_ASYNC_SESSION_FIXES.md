# Database Async Session Fixes - Dynamic Taxonomy RAG v1.8.1

## Issue Summary
The document ingestion pipeline was failing due to async session handling issues where `db_manager.get_session()` was being called without `await`, causing "coroutine was never awaited" errors.

## Root Cause
In the `ingestion_pipeline.py` file, there were two locations where the async method `db_manager.get_session()` was called without proper `await`:

1. **Line 405**: In `_save_to_database()` method
2. **Line 513**: In `get_processing_status()` method

Additionally, the test file `test_document_ingestion_comprehensive.py` had the same issue at:
- **Line 831**: In `_verify_database_storage()` method

## Database Manager Analysis
From `apps/api/database.py`, line 249:
```python
async def get_session(self):
    """Îç∞Ïù¥ÌÑ∞Î≤†Ïù¥Ïä§ ÏÑ∏ÏÖò Î∞òÌôò"""
    return self.async_session()
```

The `get_session()` method is defined as async, requiring `await` when called.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed ingestion_pipeline.py
**Before:**
```python
async with db_manager.get_session() as session:
```

**After:**
```python
async with await db_manager.get_session() as session:
```

**Locations fixed:**
- Line 405: `_save_to_database()` method
- Line 513: `get_processing_status()` method

### 2. Fixed test_document_ingestion_comprehensive.py
**Before:**
```python
async with db_manager.get_session() as session:
```

**After:**
```python
async with await db_manager.get_session() as session:
```

**Location fixed:**
- Line 831: `_verify_database_storage()` method

## Verification
All other async context manager uses in the codebase were checked and found to be correct:
- `db_manager.async_session()` - correctly used without await (returns session directly)
- `async_session()` - correctly used without await (factory function)
- Other async context managers - all properly implemented

## Impact
These fixes resolve the primary issue preventing document ingestion tests from running successfully. The async session handling is now consistent with SQLAlchemy's async patterns and should eliminate the "coroutine was never awaited" errors.

## Files Modified
1. `apps/ingestion/ingestion_pipeline.py` - 2 fixes
2. `test_document_ingestion_comprehensive.py` - 1 fix

## Next Steps
With the async session fixes in place, the document ingestion pipeline should now:
1. Successfully create database sessions
2. Complete document processing workflow
3. Pass integration tests
4. Support both SQLite (testing) and PostgreSQL (production) databases

## Testing Status
- **Database Connection Tests**: ‚úÖ 100% pass rate (4/4)
- **Hybrid Search Tests**: ‚úÖ 71.4% pass rate (5/7)
- **Document Ingestion Tests**: üîÑ Ready for re-testing with fixes applied

The async session fixes address the core infrastructure issues that were preventing comprehensive testing of the document ingestion pipeline.
