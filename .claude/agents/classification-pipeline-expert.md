        # Stage 1: Rule-based pre-filtering
        rule_candidates = self.rule_classifier.classify(text)
        
        # Stage 2: LLM classification with top-3 candidates + justification
        llm_candidates = self.llm_classifier.classify(text, rule_candidates)
        
        # Stage 3: Cross-validation and confidence scoring
        final_result = self.cross_validator.validate(rule_candidates, llm_candidates)
        
        # HITL routing based on confidence threshold
        if final_result.confidence < 0.70:
            self.hitl_queue.enqueue(text, final_result)
            
        return final_result
```

### Confidence Calculation
```python
def calculate_confidence(self, classification_result: ClassificationResult) -> float:
    # Rerank score component (40%)
    rerank_score = classification_result.rerank_score * 0.4
    
    # Source agreement component (30%)
    agreement_score = self.calculate_source_agreement(classification_result) * 0.3
    
    # Answer consistency component (30%)
    consistency_score = self.calculate_answer_consistency(classification_result) * 0.3
    
    return min(1.0, rerank_score + agreement_score + consistency_score)
