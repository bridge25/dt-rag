# Start server immediately without waiting for migrations

# Note: pgvector extension must be manually enabled in Railway PostgreSQL dashboard

# IMPORTANT: For Railway free tier, we skip blocking migrations to ensure fast startup
# Migrations can be run manually via: railway run alembic upgrade heads
