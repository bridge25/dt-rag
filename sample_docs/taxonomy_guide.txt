Dynamic Taxonomy Classification Guide

The DT-RAG system implements a dynamic, versioned taxonomy system based on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure.

Taxonomy Architecture:
- Hierarchical Classification: Multi-level categories from general to specific
- Canonical Paths: Each document has a primary classification path (e.g., ["Technology", "AI/ML", "RAG"])
- Version Control: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning with full migration history
- Rollback Support: Transaction-safe rollback to any previous taxonomy version

Classification Pipeline (Hybrid Approach):
1. Rule-Based Filtering: Initial classification using keyword patterns and document metadata
2. LLM Candidate Generation: Generate 2-3 candidate classifications with reasoning
3. Cross-Validation: Verify classifications against multiple criteria
4. Confidence Scoring: Calculate confidence based on agreement and evidence strength
5. HITL Queue: Route low-confidence items (< 0.70) to human review

Key Tables (PRD v1.8.1):
- taxonomy_nodes: DAG node definitions with canonical paths and confidence scores
- taxonomy_edges: Parent-child relationships with version awareness
- doc_taxonomy: Document-taxonomy mappings with confidence and HITL flags
- taxonomy_migrations: Version migration history with rationale

Benefits:
- Flexible Organization: Add, move, or merge categories without breaking references
- Quality Control: Confidence thresholds and human validation ensure accuracy
- Auditability: Complete history of taxonomy changes with rollback capability
- Scalability: DAG structure supports unlimited hierarchy depth

The taxonomy version (e.g., "1.0.0") is tracked for every classification,
enabling safe schema evolution and A/B testing of classification strategies.
