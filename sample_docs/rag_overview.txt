Dynamic Taxonomy RAG System Overview

This document describes the Dynamic Taxonomy RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system v1.8.1,
which combines advanced hybrid search capabilities with dynamic document classification.

Key Features:
- Hybrid Search: Combines BM25 keyword search with vector similarity search using 1536-dimensional embeddings
- Dynamic Taxonomy: DAG-based hierarchical classification with versioning and rollback support
- Cross-Encoder Reranking: Improves search result relevance using ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 model
- HITL Workflow: Human-in-the-loop classification for low-confidence predictions
- RAGAS Evaluation: Comprehensive quality assessment using Faithfulness, Context Precision, Context Recall, and Answer Relevancy metrics

Architecture Components:
1. Document Ingestion Pipeline: Supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, and HTML formats with intelligent chunking (500 tokens, 128 overlap)
2. Embedding Service: OpenAI text-embedding-3-large for semantic vector representations
3. Search Engine: PostgreSQL pgvector with IVFFlat index for efficient similarity search
4. Classification Service: Multi-stage pipeline with rule-based filtering and LLM validation
5. Orchestration Layer: LangGraph-based 7-step RAG workflow with MCP tool integration

Performance Requirements (PRD v1.8.1):
- p95 latency ≤ 4 seconds
- Average cost per query ≤ ₩10
- Faithfulness score ≥ 0.85
- HITL rate ≤ 30%
- Rollback TTR ≤ 15 minutes

The system uses UUID-based primary keys throughout for distributed scalability and follows
the PRD Annex C.4 schema specification for all database tables.
