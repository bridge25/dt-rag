# SPEC-SOFTQ-001: Acceptance Criteria for Soft Q-learning Bandit System

## 0. Overview
Comprehensive acceptance criteria for the Soft Q-learning Bandit system, ensuring robust, adaptive strategy selection in the DT-RAG pipeline.

## 1. Functional Acceptance Scenarios

### Scenario 1: State Space Encoding
**Given** a diverse set of input queries with varying complexity
**When** the state encoder processes these queries
**Then** the state representation must:
- Correctly map to 108 discrete states
- Quantize features into Low/Medium/High bins
- Maintain semantic information integrity
- Handle edge cases and outlier inputs

### Scenario 2: Retrieval Strategy Selection
**Given** multiple query types (factual, conceptual, complex)
**When** the Soft Q-learning system selects a retrieval strategy
**Then** it should:
- Choose the most appropriate strategy (BM25/Vector/Hybrid)
- Demonstrate >70% confidence in selection
- Provide explainable reasoning for the choice
- Adapt strategy based on historical performance

### Scenario 3: Composition Strategy Selection
**Given** various response generation requirements
**When** the system decides between extractive and generative composition
**Then** it must:
- Select strategy aligned with query intent
- Maintain response quality across different tasks
- Minimize information loss
- Provide context-aware composition

### Scenario 4: Reward Function Validation
**Given** a series of search and answer generation tasks
**When** the reward is calculated
**Then** it should:
- Correctly weigh confidence (70%) and latency (30%)
- Reflect true performance of strategy selection
- Handle complex, multi-dimensional evaluation
- Prevent reward hacking or optimization loopholes

### Scenario 5: Exploration-Exploitation Balance
**Given** repeated interactions with similar query patterns
**When** the Q-learning policy operates
**Then** it must:
- Maintain Ï„=0.5 temperature for balanced exploration
- Prevent converging to suboptimal strategies
- Show gradual learning and strategy refinement
- Detect and adapt to changing query landscapes
