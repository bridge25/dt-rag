## üéØ Quick Summary (TL;DR)

### What Happened
Your SPEC-TEST-003 implementation is **FUNCTIONALLY COMPLETE** (11 tests, all passing) but **NOT SYNCHRONIZED** with documentation.

### What's Missing
4 simple synchronization tasks:
1. Update SPEC metadata (v0.1.0, completed) - 5 min
2. Add @CODE:TEST-003 tags to 3 files - 5 min
3. Update README.md with Performance section - 10 min
4. Verify TAG integrity - 5 min
**Total Time**: ~20-25 minutes

### What You Should Do
1. Read: **SPEC-TEST-003-ANALYSIS-COMPLETE.md** (understand the situation)
2. Read: **SPEC-TEST-003-SYNC-QUICKREF.md** (execute the tasks)
3. Execute: 4 synchronization tasks using the quick reference
4. Verify: TAG integrity with provided commands
5. Submit: PR with SPEC-TEST-003 completion notes

### Risk Level
**LOW** (documentation-only changes, fully reversible via Git)

### Blocking Issue
**1** (SPEC metadata update blocks PR merge)

### High Priority Issues
**2** (CODE TAG insertion + README update needed)

### Confidence Level
**95%** (HIGH - comprehensive analysis)
