      "query": "How does hierarchical classification work in taxonomies?",
      "expected_answer": "Hierarchical classification in taxonomies organizes information in tree-like structures where each level represents increasing specificity. Parent nodes represent broader categories while child nodes represent more specific subcategories. Classification algorithms assign content to the most appropriate path through this hierarchy, considering both the content's features and the hierarchical relationships between categories.",
      "expected_contexts": [
        "Hierarchical taxonomies mirror natural categorization patterns used by humans",
        "Each level in the hierarchy should represent a meaningful distinction in granularity",
        "Classification confidence often decreases as you move deeper into the hierarchy",
        "Multi-path classification allows content to belong to multiple taxonomy branches"

      "query": "What are the advantages of dynamic versus static taxonomy systems?",
      "expected_answer": "Dynamic taxonomy systems automatically adapt to new content and evolving domains by discovering new categories and adjusting classifications based on content patterns. This provides better coverage of emerging topics and reduces maintenance overhead. Static taxonomies offer more stability and consistency but require manual updates and may become outdated. Dynamic systems are better for rapidly evolving domains while static systems work well for stable, well-defined domains.",
      "expected_contexts": [
        "Dynamic systems use machine learning to evolve taxonomy structure over time",
        "Static systems provide consistent categorization but require human maintenance",
        "Hybrid approaches combine the stability of static core taxonomies with dynamic extensions",

      "query": "How do you measure taxonomy classification accuracy?",
      "expected_answer": "Taxonomy classification accuracy is measured using hierarchical metrics that account for the tree structure: (1) Exact match accuracy for perfect path predictions, (2) Hierarchical precision and recall that give partial credit for partially correct paths, (3) Distance-based metrics that measure how far predictions are from true paths, and (4) Level-wise accuracy that evaluates performance at each hierarchy level. These metrics provide more nuanced evaluation than flat classification metrics.",
      "expected_contexts": [
        "Hierarchical metrics give partial credit for getting parent categories correct even if leaf categories are wrong",
        "Distance-based metrics like tree-edit distance measure how many steps separate predicted and true paths",
        "Level-wise evaluation helps identify which hierarchy levels are most challenging",
        "Multi-label scenarios require additional considerations for multiple valid paths"

      "query": "What is the role of confidence scores in taxonomy classification?",
      "expected_answer": "Confidence scores in taxonomy classification indicate the system's certainty about its classification decisions. They help with: (1) Filtering low-confidence predictions for human review, (2) Implementing multi-level classification where high-confidence predictions go deeper in the hierarchy, (3) Providing transparency to users about prediction reliability, and (4) Enabling threshold-based quality control. Confidence calibration ensures these scores accurately reflect prediction accuracy.",
      "expected_contexts": [
        "Well-calibrated confidence scores accurately reflect the probability of correct classification",
        "Confidence thresholds can trigger human-in-the-loop workflows for uncertain cases",
        "Hierarchical confidence can vary by taxonomy level, with higher confidence at broader levels",

      "query": "How do you handle multi-label classification in taxonomies?",
      "expected_answer": "Multi-label classification in taxonomies allows content to belong to multiple categories simultaneously. This is handled through: (1) Independent binary classifiers for each taxonomy path, (2) Threshold-based multi-label prediction where paths above confidence thresholds are selected, (3) Constraint enforcement to ensure valid path combinations, and (4) Hierarchical consistency checks to prevent conflicting assignments. This approach better reflects real-world content that often spans multiple topics.",

        "Real-world content often belongs to multiple categories naturally",
        "Binary relevance treats each taxonomy path as an independent classification problem",
