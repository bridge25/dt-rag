# ⚠️ Archived: Team Collaboration Documents

> **Status**: ARCHIVED
> **Date**: 2025-10-14
> **Reason**: Project converted from team collaboration to single-developer mode

## 📋 What Happened?

This directory contains documents that were originally created for A/B/C team collaboration structure:
- **A-team**: Database & API (PostgreSQL + FastAPI)
- **B-team**: Orchestration (LangGraph + CBR)
- **C-team**: Frontend (Next.js Admin Dashboard)

However, the project evolved into **single-developer mode**, where one developer successfully integrated all three components into a unified system.
