      "question": "How do neural networks work?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Information flows through the network, and connections between neurons have weights that are adjusted during training to improve performance.",

      "question": "How does transfer learning improve model performance?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Transfer learning improves model performance by leveraging knowledge learned from one task to help solve a different but related task. Pre-trained models can be fine-tuned on new datasets with less data and computational resources while achieving better performance than training from scratch.",
